## 1.0.0

The package is solving a problem with package bottom_personalized_dot_bar as it solves i's issues and issues can be summarized in the following points:
- it's old and the owner didn't update it since 3 years.
- Some exception was caught by gestures.
- no clear definition for the max number and min number of displayed items.
- forget changes that take places in the displayed and  hidden items in eah run, so the user setup will be forgetten once the app is closed.
- not cross platform.

The Btn Nav bat is very beautiful and many people likes it so much. For these reasons I build this package for public to help them to add this beautful btn nav bar to their projets. I wish this will help you.
